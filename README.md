We are working on the Intern Project data analysis of Fatalities of Isreal and Palestine, we work on the code on various data anlysis field along with the presentation.

# Importance Matrix for Data Analysis of Fatalities in Israel and Palestine
## Overview:
This repository contains the importance matrix outlining the roles and responsibilities of team members involved in the data analysis of fatalities in Israel and Palestine. The matrix delineates each member's tasks and contributions to ensure a comprehensive and effective analysis of the dataset.

## Importance Matrix:
The importance matrix provides a structured framework for organizing and assigning tasks within the team. It helps clarify individual responsibilities, promote collaboration, and ensure that each aspect of the analysis process is addressed with diligence and expertise

## Usage:
* Review the importance matrix to understand each team member's role and responsibilities.
* Collaborate effectively with team members to ensure a comprehensive analysis process.
* Refer to the presentation slides and visualizations for clear communication of analysis findings.
* Continuously reflect on the analysis process to identify areas for improvement and future research directions
